Setting Up Environment Variables and Connecting to Databases Locally
1. Clone the Repository:
    Type the following in the terminal:
    bash
    Copy code
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>

2. Create a PostgreSQL Database:
    Create a PostgreSQL database with a name that matches your data file. You can use a tool like psql or a GUI client. Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and running.

    Type the following in the terminal:

3. Create .env File:
    In the root directory of your project, create a .env file if it doesn't already exist.

4. Add Environment Variables:
    Inside the .env file, add the following environment variables and code:
        PGDATABASE=<your-database-name>
        DB_FILE_PATH=<path-to-your-database-file>
    
    Replace <your-database-name> with the name of your PostgreSQL database and <path-to-your-database-file> with the path to your SQL database file.

5. Install Dependencies:
    Run the following command to install the required dependencies from the package.json file:
        npm install

6. Database Connection Setup:
    In your project, ensure that the database connection is established properly using the environment variables. Look for the file responsible for establishing the database connection (often found in a db.js, connection.js, or similar file) and modify it to use the PGDATABASE and DB_FILE_PATH environment variables.

7. Create Controllers and Models:
    Set up the necessary controllers and models to interact with your database. Create these files if they don't exist already.

8. Seed the Database:
    If your project requires seeding data into the database, create a seeding script (often named seed.js or similar). Run the script to populate your database with initial data.

9. Set Up Jest Tests (Optional):
    If your project includes Jest tests, ensure that the tests are correctly configured to use the environment variables for database connections.

10. Start the Application:
    Start your application using the appropriate command (often npm start or node index.js).

11. Handling Missing Environment Variables:
    If the PGDATABASE environment variable is missing, your application should handle this case and display an error message to the user, indicating that the database cannot be accessed without the necessary environment variables.
    
    Example error message in your code:
        if (!process.env.PGDATABASE) {
        console.error("Error: PGDATABASE environment variable is missing. Cannot access the database.");
        process.exit(1); // Exit the application with an error code
        }
